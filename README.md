SimbaDroid is an SMB server for Android, allowing you to access the contents of your storage (both
internal storage or an external SD card) from your computer via wi-fi.

## Notes

Due to Android limitations, this app requires root (as on all Unixoid operating systems, it is not
possible to open a port < 1024 otherwise, and the default SMB port is 445 and Windows doesn't work
with anything else) for full functionality. Without root, you either need some sort of SMB client
which allows configuring the port used (SimbaDroid uses port 4450 behind the scenes), or some kind
of [port mapping setup](https://serverfault.com/questions/1011395/access-smb-over-a-custom-port/1065212#1065212)
to allow Windows to transparently connect to port 4450.

Recent Windows 11 releases starting from 24H2 also allow specifying a port number when connecting to
an SMB share from the command line, e.g PowerShell:
```
New-SmbMapping -LocalPath "Z:" -RemotePath "\\simbadroid.local\Internal" -TcpPort 4450
```
… respectively via the regular command line:
```
net use Z: \\simbadroid.local\Internal /TCPPORT:4450
```

Due to [JFileServer](https://github.com/FileSysOrg/jfileserver) limitations, only SMBv1 is
supported, which isn't ideal for modern Windows, either, but c'est la vie…

Since the app is mostly for my private use, at the moment there are no configuration options –
shares for the internal storage (*"Internal"*) as well as an external SD card (*"External"* – if one
is detected) are set up automatically and are accessible without authentication, so be careful about
using this app in public networks. I might add some options for configuring your own custom shares
and user authentication eventually, but no guarantees as to if and when.

`READ/WRITE/MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` is required for filesystem access.

## Compatibility

SimbaDroid should run on Android 6 and newer, though only Android 6 and 14 have been tested so far.
